   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
  <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
   <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
   <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
    <li> ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
   <li> 1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
   <li> 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
   <li> 1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
   <li >1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
    <li> tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
   <li> Salt</li>
  
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h2>Put pasta water on to boil:</h2>
        <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Brown the ground beef:</h2>
        <p>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.

            Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Bake:</h2>
        <p>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce). Bake at 375Â°F for 45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.</p>
    </li>
